# Prize
Some of the challenges assign a prize as a stimuli for the improvement of important concepts or routines. We don't want to offer cash because perhaps it wouldn't adequately compensate for the dedication invested in completing the task. We prefer to believe that the motivation is the quest for knowledge. So, we prefer that you choose among one of this:
- First month paid at Coursera for the "Deep Learning Specialization" by Deeplearning.ai
- A four months subscription in codigofacilito.com (spanish)
- The book "Building Machine Learning Powered Applications" by Emmanuel Ameisen
- The book "Introduction to Natural Language Processing" by Jacob Einsestein
- A new Raspberry Pi board

## Claim
Each entry that is aspiring to obtain a prize needs to be validated in accordance to the rules described in its respective category. If the claim is succesful, the organizer will proceed to deliver the prize to the address given beforehand or to provide the given enrollment.

Each claim must be unique. If a claim is too similar to another previously awarded, it will be discarded unless it could be asserted that it came from an independient development process.

## Join the team
As we cannot guarantee a full time job in our company for all the winners, certainly we have some projects and collaborations to offer. Our main interest is in building a strong and passionate community. We are committed in growing personal skills and social interaction.
