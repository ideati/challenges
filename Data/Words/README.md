# Words

## Objective
Obtain the top 10 words in a long text (book), sorted by the number of appearances. The faster implementation wins.

A valid entry is any program, compiled or interpreted and able to run on a [Raspberry Pi 3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/), as the platform of choice to profile the solution. Use any programming language, library or tool. You don't need to have a RPi, it will be used just to determine the speed with respect to the reference implementation and assign the prize. 

## License
Each author retains the rights to his/her code, but each entry shall have a OSI approved license in order to be considered for participation.

## Conditions
- The entry shall work on any text with UTF-8 encoding. As an example, a long book in the Public Domain is available: [Don Quijote de la Mancha](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2000/pg2000.txt) (Spanish, Project Gutenberg Book No.2000) in order to test the suitability of the algorithm. This book has 23.591 different words for a total of 384.324 words. By the way: it's such a wonderful book!
- Spanish was choosen to verify the correctness of the implementation beyond the ASCII range. The search is case insensitive.
- Discard articles, conjunctions and propositions from the list. You don't need to know spanish to do it. There is a list of the words to be discarded here: [discard_es.txt](https://github.com/ideati/challenges/blob/master/Data/Words/discard_es.txt).
- Discard numeric entities or words mixed with numbers.
- The source code of each participant entry shall be pushed to this repository and tested in a RPi 3 (Headless, with nothing attached, just the memory card).
- There is a penalty of 1 ms for each kb needed to execute the entry. This puts in disadvantage the interpreted languages with respect to native compiled solutions. For instance: a shell script will carry the size of the minimal shell required to run it.
- The entry that obtain the right solution faster than the reference implementation will receive a [prize](https://github.com/ideati/challenges/blob/master/PRIZE.md). The reference implementation will be revealed once the contest ends.

## Results
The current performance of the reference implementation in a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Rev 1.2 is:
```sh
$ ./wordc
Word counter v.0.0.1
Use: ./wordc filename.txt [exclusions.txt]

$ time ./wordc pg2000.txt ../discard_es.txt
0.  "no" 6345
1.  "se" 4690
2.  "su" 3352
3.  "don" 2652
4.  "me" 2345
5.  "quijote" 2180
6.  "sancho" 2148
7.  "es" 2142
8.  "yo" 2077
9.  "mÃ¡s" 2044

real    0m0,308s
user    0m0,556s
sys     0m0,031s

$ ls -Al wordc
-rwxr-xr-x 1 jorge jorge 20296 abr 12 03:31 wordc
```
The penalty is: 20.3 kb -> 0.020 s.

Total performance for the reference implementation: 0.308 - 0.031 + 0.020 = 0.297 seconds (This is the mark to beat to win the [prize](https://github.com/ideati/challenges/blob/master/PRIZE.md))

Note that the user time is greater than the real time. This happens when a program is making use of parallel execution. There are 4 cores in the Raspberri Pi. The actual elapsed time, as taken with a stopwatch is the so called real.
