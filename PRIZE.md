# Prize
Some of the challenges assign a prize as a stimuli for the improvement of important concepts or routines. We don't want to offer cash because perhaps it wouldn't adequately compensate for the dedication invested in completing the task. We prefer to believe that the motivation is driven by the quest for knowledge. So, if you are entitled for one or more of those prizes, you can select one of this:
- Enrollment on the course xxx in Coursera (english with subtitles in several languages)
- A xxx months subscription in codigofacilito.com (spanish)
- The book xxx by xxx
- A Raspberry Pi 3

## Claim
Each entry that is aspiring to obtain a prize needs to be validated in accordance to the rules described in its respective category. If the claim is succesful, the organizer will proceed to deliver the prize to the address given beforehand or to provide the given enrollment.

## Join the team
As we cannot guarantee a full time job in our company for the winners, certainly we have some projects and collaborations to offer. Our main interest is in building a strong and passionate community. We are committed to the growth both personal and social.
